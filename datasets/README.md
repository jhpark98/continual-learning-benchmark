# Continual Learning Benchmark: Human Activity Recognition Datasets

This repository reproduces the experiments in the [Continual Learning Benchmark](https://github.com/srvCodes/continual-learning-benchmark) focused on micro-F1 performance for human activity recognition using real-world wearable sensor datasets.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The original Google Drive link to the datasets is broken. This README provides alternative verified sources to obtain the datasets individually.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

To prepare the datasets:

1. Download all datasets into a common folder structure (e.g., `./datasets/`).
2. Use the scripts provided in `utils/data_handler.py` and `utils/join_pickles.py` from the [original repository](https://github.com/srvCodes/continual-learning-benchmark) to:
   - Clean and normalize time-series data
   - Align sampling rates
   - Export `.pkl` files for each dataset and task
